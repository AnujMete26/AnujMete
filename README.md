About Me

I’m a detail-oriented QA enthusiast with a background in Civil Engineering and a strong pivot into the field of Software Testing. My career path reflects adaptability, structure, and a hands-on understanding of real-world project delivery.

After gaining 3+ years of practical experience in managing civil site operations, I transitioned into software testing with the same focus on precision, quality, and planning. I’ve completed professional training in Manual Testing and am currently pursuing Automation Testing using Selenium and API Testing with Postman.

In my recent manual testing project on OpenCart (an open-source e-commerce application), I independently crafted:
- 📋 A comprehensive Test Plan
- ✅ Over 500 test cases across 30+ functional modules
- 🐞 Logged 20+ bugs with detailed documentation (severity, priority, reproduction steps) in **Jira**
- 🔗 Developed a full Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- 📤 Executed and reported test cycles using **Zephyr**, simulating Agile sprints

I believe in clear documentation, test coverage visibility, and traceability-first testing — traits that align with enterprise QA best practices.

Currently, I am refining my automation skills with Java, Selenium, TestNG, and exploring RESTful APIs through Postman — building toward becoming a full-stack SDET.
